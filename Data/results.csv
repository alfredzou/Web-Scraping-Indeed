 CDF’s employee values
 Values  –   CDF is practically tasked with the provision of capital to Catholic organisations to
 support their growth and it does so consistent with the mandate above. The manner in which
 CDF seeks to undertake its work is also guided by scripture. The following scripture have been
 identified as particularly relevant:
 Care for others –  ‘I give you a new commandment: love one another; you must love
 one another just as I have loved you. It is by your love for one another, that everyone
 will recognise you as my disciples.’  John 13:34-35 
 The importance of wealth –  ‘Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where
 moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up yourselves
 treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not
 break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.’  Matt 6:19- 
 
21 
 Sharing wealth –  ‘And the crowds asked him, “What then shall we do? And he
 answered them, “Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and
 whoever has food is to do likewise.”  Luke 3:10-11
 ‘Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, and he saw
 as poor widow put in two small copper coins. And he said “Truly, I tell you, the poor
 widow has put in more than all of them. For they all contributed out of their abundance,
 but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on”.’  Luke 21:1-4",http://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=de73ea872589266e&fccid=65ec42a95157c44a&vjs=3

Strong interpersonal skills – able to build successful and constructive business relationships. 
Comfortable in taking calculated risks in the interest of gaining and sharing relevant learnings. 
Humanistic & encouraging nature – willing to learn, share, support other team members and not be ‘perfectionistic’. 
Achievement oriented and results driven. 
Commercially minded – Understand P&L. 
Resilience: (i.e. able to stay the course & make things happen). 
 
Our Growth Culture: 
One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola. 
 
Curious 
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.
 
 Empowered 
Make it happen .  True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action. 
 
Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete. 
 
Inclusive 
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

Business Analyst,Kogan.com,South Melbourne VIC 3205,,"We’re seeking out a driven Business Analyst to play a key role in our fast-paced digital product development team! We’re not going to lie - it’s not an easy gig - there is a huge amount of responsibility and impact for this role - but for the right candidate, it will be the best role you’ve ever had! ;)
 
The software we build (and there is a lot!) is used by millions of customers, so this role has a huge impact. The team you will be a key member of is fast-paced, independent, ambitious and proficient across the full tech stack. They’ll challenge your assumptions and proposed solutions, and push you to better solve problems or define solutions.
 
If you’re looking for a regular 9-5 office job then we’re not for you. We’re looking for ambitious people prepared to do whatever is required to get the right solution live for our customers and built efficiently - advocating for the best customer experience on Kogan.com.
 
 In order to join the team, you’ll be: 
 
 A problem solver with an analytical mindset, even better, if you have experience with business, data, customer (or even financial-type) analysis! We are looking for exceptional logic and analytical skills over limiting our reach to people only in software development. 
 Someone with excellent communication skills, ideally experienced in ‘managing’ stakeholders, project management and gathering requirements from the business to achieve the desired outcome(s). You’ll both learn about, present and optimise business goals to our tech team in order for the right technology to be built, efficiently. 
 Someone with great attention to detail, whilst being able to manage multiple priorities and lots of context switching - you will thrive on knowing everything from the broader business objective(s) to the edge cases. 
 Experience with software development is a plus, but if you do, we want you to care about the full SDLC and not just writing BRD’s! You’ll love working alongside our developers and designers to advocate for the business, customer and technology objectives. 
 Someone who is accountable, organised, upbeat, super motivated and experimental. We want our business analysts to be passionate about building amazing software and technology solutions for our millions of customers - whether that be new functionality on the sites we build and maintain, integrations with third parties or performance optimisations to keep everything running super smoothly for our customers! 
 
 What you’ll do: 
You will be working within our core engineering team to service both our internal stakeholders and most importantly, our customers. To do this, your role on the team will be to:
 
 
 Be the ‘front door’ of our tech team - working with our site and customer data, stakeholders, partners and customers to agree, document and prioritise future and in-flight technology changes. 
 Break down ambitious business goals into smaller technology deliverables that our software engineers can iteratively push through to production; 
 Understand and document acceptance criteria, facilitating scope management, quality and timeliness as a requirement makes it way through the entire software delivery lifecycle; 
 Drive the focus on shipping to production as quickly as possible, using data to identify, escalate and improve delivery bottlenecks to ensure our software delivery lifecycle flows efficiently; and 
 Understand and document estimated and actual business value delivered to provide insights into future improvements. 
 Understand how to organise your workload and break down your time to focus on tasks and get outcomes delivered daily

Senior Data Engineer,HotDoc,Melbourne VIC,"$120,000 - $140,000 a year","What’s the job? 
HotDoc is looking for an ethically minded Senior Data Engineer to help us change how doctors and patients communicate. Help us take the next step forward on our journey in improving patient healthcare one algorithm at a time. Are you an operational thinker? Are you looking to apply your experience in building data analytic systems in a way that is meaningful? This is an incredible opportunity to work for a fast-growing health-tech startup where you have both scope and support for professional and personal growth, your opinions are heard, and your actions make a difference to thousands of patients and healthcare providers across Australia. 
 
What’s in it for you? 
We offer a market salary with startup perks. You’ll get to experience your contribution to the company first hand. Enjoy flexible work arrangements while thriving in an ethically driven company that fosters inclusivity and a collaborative work environment, where personal development and career progression aren’t just buzz words. 
What will you be doing? 
In this role, reporting to the Head of Operations, you'll help set a vision for data-driven, automated company operations, and work with a small team of dedicated engineers and data scientists to execute that vision.
 You’ll collaborate with people across the business to identify their data requirements, then design and build pipelines to blend data from varied sources into a usable format to support those operations 
 You’ll implement code & data quality testing procedures to ensure the trustworthiness of the data 
 Along the way, you will help set the way the operations data team functions — codifying HotDoc’s framework for incorporating new systems, datasets, reports, and analytics 
 Our stack is based around Stitch, Airflow, BigQuery, and Metabase, with a lot of Python glue — but nothing is set in stone. Whether you think we should move to a serverless Rust backbone that uses Presto to query a Datomic model and display it in a custom d3 + WebGL frontend, or if you think we should just use cron, curl, Postgres and sendmail — we’re all ears. 
Who will you be doing it for? 
 As the preferred vendor of healthcare software solutions, HotDoc is improving the patient experience for over 4 million Australians and counting. HotDoc helps bridge the gap between patient and doctors nationwide, by providing cutting edge technology and an easy, proactive, and accessible means of managing the patient journey from booking to check-in. 
Requirements 
What you must have 
 Experience building data pipelines end-to-end, from source systems to data products 
 Experience working with modern data engineering technologies like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Apache Airflow, or similar 
 Fluency in Python and SQL 
 What we’d love you to have 
 Familiarity with software engineering best practices, using software collaboration tools like GitHub 
 Experience working directly with stakeholders to determine requirements at all scales, whether it’s to support a whole-of-business operations process, or a specific statistic to be included in a specific report requested by a customer 
 Experience leading engineers in a small, dynamic team (this role does not have formal direct reports, but is a senior role within the team) 
 Wisdom to know when to extend existing tools, when to build new ones, and when to just use a spreadsheet

About You 
 
You’ve built a lot of software – shipped products, created platforms, tools and modules, worked with every framework under the sun and have built big, distributed, API-driven systems with thousands of users. You’re as excited as we are about learning every day, and solving really hard engineering problems that no one else is. You've also operated services and/or scaled software at a high level, ensuring customer up-time and safety are your foremost tenets. 
 
You're passionate about software quality, repeatability, testability and maintainability in production, you are known to your co-workers as the go-to person for answers to questions that begin with the phrase “what’s the best way to…” – even though your answers tend to start with “help me understand what you’re trying to accomplish by…”. When you need clarity, you go to the product owner – or even a user – and talk to them until you get it. With stakeholders and other team members you are diplomatic, persuasive, and usually right. You understand the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in production, and your designs and 
implementations reflect that understanding. 
 
When you’re wrong, you’re happy to learn something. You build software quickly, but properly (so that you don’t have to go back to it later). You know what unit tests are and don’t implement software without them. Shipping on time with high quality makes your heart feel warm. 
 
You're an operationally focused and a DevOps zealot. You instrument your code, and help others instrument theirs. You have an interest in software performance, love metrics, and never stop digging for root cause when an issue arises. 
 
What You’ll Do 
 Deliver project items on-time / in-spec, communicating clearly with leads, manager and stakeholders. Drive software and database architecture / design Drive and lead architecture / design conversations and code reviews (yours and other team members’) Engineer operationally driven software solutions which automate everything and scale over time. Work with managers and team members to estimate effort and clarify/negotiate /document scope and design. Drive design, architecture, process and development standards Mentor junior team members, helping to maintain appropriate unit test coverage, code documentation, software structure and supportability Distill and communicate technical concepts to more junior developers and stakeholders Advocate for the right outcomes with data, conviction and diplomacy Identify, evaluate and suggest mitigation strategies for risks during design Design and implement features for new and existing products, features, APIs, platforms and frameworks. 
 
 Experience with distributed computing and large-scale systems, taking a leading role in building complex software systems that have been successfully delivered to customers. Exposure to large-scale distributed storage and database systems (e.g. SQL, NoSQL, Graph Databases) Have mentored software engineers to help improve their skills, efficiency and productivity. Delivered software in an environment that utilises Agile methodologies like SCRUM or Kanban. Hand on experience with AWS services such as RDS, EC2, Dynamo DB, CloudWatch.
